        <p>Hi there, I'm Rick Boshae, a recent college grad living in Los Angeles, California. In a nutshell, you can say I am an aspiring Software Engineer with the spirit of an entrepreneur. I find everything about creating software amazing. The design, development, maintenance, and testing wrapped together to ship an awesome product. My favorite part of the entire process is exchanging ideas with other engineers. With each project I strive to explore new tech while creating something akin to magic.
