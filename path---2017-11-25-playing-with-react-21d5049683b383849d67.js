This quarter in particular is a busy one. I\'m learning Graphics, Operating Systems, Software Engineering, and Technical Communication. It really is a big time requirement but so much fun. On the plus side, I\'ve gained a new set of skills to sharpen.</p>\n<p>A very neat project I\'ve been working on for the past 5 weeks is <a href="http://huddlereflex.me/">Huddle</a> (-- be nice! Huddle is in alpha ). Inspired by Trello, Huddle is a collaborative tool that organizes projects into boards. Each board is made up of columns (or lists) which hold a set of cards that correspond to user stories or tasks.</p>\n<p><img style="margin: auto;\n    display: flex;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RBoshae/Personal-Website-1/master/images/Huddle-Board-View.png" alt="Huddle Board View" height="85%" width="85%"></p>\n<p>I designed the webapp with four other CS students at UC Riverside.\nThis is one of the first major projects I\'ve worked on with my peers at UCR. It was a great way to practice team skills and dividing a large project into manageable parts. I am super grateful for taking a Software Engineering course and recommend it to everyone.</p>\n<p>The best part about building Huddle was learning how to program with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and incorporating <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a>. If you\'ve been thinking about using React to build a webapp of your own I absolutely recommend it. A big shoutout to Google for Firebase too, it is so great! To get started on React I followed this <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">tutorial</a> by the reactjs site.
